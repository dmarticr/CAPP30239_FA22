# Week 3
This week we have learned the basics to build bar charts using D3 üìä. In this folder, you can find the files regarding the in-class exercise using Covid data and the homework in which we replicate the exercise with the number of visits to the libraries. Also, this folder used to include the data for the final project, but it was moved to [CAPP30239_FA22\data](https://github.com/dmarticr/CAPP30239_FA22/tree/main/data) folder with the name [vgsales.csv](https://github.com/dmarticr/CAPP30239_FA22/tree/main/data/vgsales.csv).

## Bar Chart Exercise üìù
Also, in this folder, you can find the homework regarding the library visits to the public libraries around the University of Chicago. Please refer to the ***homework.html*** file.

## Data for the Final Project üìù
For my data project, I will use Video Game Sales from more than 16,500 games.
* *Data Source*: This dataset has been taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales), being a scrape of [vgchartz](https://www.vgchartz.com/).
* *Description of data*: there are 16,598 records. Each column is detailed below:
    * **Rank**: Ranking of overall sales
    * **Name**: The games name
    * **Platform**: Platform of the games release (i.e. PC,PS4, etc.)
    * **Year**: Year of the game's release
    * **Genre**: Genre of the game
    * **Publisher**: Publisher of the game
    * **NA_Sales**: Sales in North America (in millions)
    * **EU_Sales**: Sales in Europe (in millions)
    * **JP_Sales**: Sales in Japan (in millions)
    * **Other_Sales**: Sales in the rest of the world (in millions)
    * **Global_Sales**: Total worldwide sales.
* *Why you are interested in this topic*: It is an important industry not only because of its size but because of its cultural influence. And this particular database allows me to explore its evolution over time, as well as different elements such as the most popular genres and the best-selling video games.
* *Thoughts on how you would hope to use this data & Potential data points*: This database allows several uses:
    * Historical evolution of sales per platform, region, publisher, and genre.
    * Distribution of total sales across time per same characteristics.
    * Ranking of best-sellers (may be combined with distribution across markets, like a horizontal stacked bar chart).
* Any concerns about the data: Nothing so far.
* Identify if the source is primary or secondary: It is primary data because it is first-hand data gathered by the authors through the scraping code (provided).
