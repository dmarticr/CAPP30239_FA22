                Nintendo is a Japanese video games company founded in 1889 (yes, <b>1889</b>!), 
                known for creating some of the most popular video games in history, such as Mario, 
                The Legend of Zelda, and Pokémon. Maybe you know, or unsurprisingly, that they distributed 
                the 1st video console in Japan in 1997, but did you know they started off as a <b>playing 
                    card</b> company? 
                    (<a href="https://nintendolink.com/2021/06/02/that-time-nintendo-made-sexy-playing-cards-before-video-games-nsfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">and not always for the whole family</a>)
            </p>
            <p>
                Digging into the 
                <a href="https://www.slashgear.com/862997/the-fascinating-history-of-nintendo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">company's history</a>, 
                it seems that Nintendo has been a leader in the video game industry for decades. 
                In fact, it was Nintendo who rescued this market after its 
                <a href="https://www.bugsplat.com/blog/less-serious/great-video-game-crash-1983/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">crisis in the 80s</a>. 
                However, who was once the undisputed industry leader, in recent times has faced new 
                challenges that pushed Nintendo to reinvent itself. Some believe the company has 
                fallen behind, releasing <i>weaker</i> consoles than its competitors.
            </p>
            <p>
                But success is not measured by console power, and we will see why Nintendo is not only not 
                <i>dying</i>, but still a reference in its industry.

                <h2>
                    Console vs. Games
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From a platform perspective, Nintendo is not behind its competitors in sales. The right
                    graph shows that, based on the <b>release date</b> of the video games, Nintendo's 
                    new releases have outperformed those of Sony or Microsoft, whose profits 
                    leverage heavily on previously released games.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For a couple of years now, Nintendo has been trying to do something 
                    different with their consoles (while the rest of the market orbits around two consoles 
                    that do basically the same thing). This strategy has been working out phenomenally 
                    for them, focusing on <b>portability</b> and <b>lower prices</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The latter is evident in the pie chart below. Although the comparison is unfair 
                    (Nintendo is older), the variety of consoles that Nintendo have offered is greater 
                    than Sony or Microsoft (being also cheaper than their counterparts). This has not compromised 
                    their leadership since Nintendo has the <b>greatest historical sales</b>, followed by sonny.

                Favorable results are also observed when, instead of analyzing video game sales from a console 
                hardware viewpoint, they are broken down according to <b>software production</b> (please press the 
                Publisher button below).

                Nintendo is the most profitable publisher followed by Activision and Electronic Arts (which make 
                games for Nintendo too). Also, notice that most of the video games from Sony and Microsoft 
                platforms are not developed by them. This is, although this market is less concentrated than 
                the platforms one, Nintendo still dominates.

                    Nintendo games are concentrated in 2 main categories: platform games and role-playing games. 
                    Of the first, Nintendo accounts for around half of the historical sales of the entire market, 
                    while of the second category around a third (left chart).

                <p>
                    Here is an interesting fact: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_game" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">platform games</a> 
                    are nothing more than those games where you have 
                    to move a character from one place to another on the board (like Mario), and this category 
                    practically <b>born</b> with a video game from this company in 1981: Donkey Kong, "
                    <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/12/20/master-of-play" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>the first 
                        to have a substantial narrative, along with a sense of humor</i></a>".
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mario debuted in that video game as <a href="https://time.com/3901489/donkey-kong-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jumpman</a>, being one of the first characters to 
                    ever actually <b>jump</b> up in a video game (now it seems insubstantial, but that was such a 
                    hit at that time!).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Regarding latitudes, the database does not allow us to reach interesting conclusions, most 
                    video games are unclassified in this matter. For the classified, total market sales are 
                    concentrated in North America and Europe, while Japan Nintendo Sales exceed those of other 
                    regions.

                Last but not least, Nintendo leads the top of <b>most popular</b> games of all times. 
                In the chart below are the 30 most sold games in whole history and Nintendo is the publisher 
                of several ones (red circles), but most important, it has the first (<i>Tetris</i>), 
                second (<i>Pokemon</i>) and fourth (<i>Super Mario</i>) place in that ranking; however, 
                all of them are more than 20 years old!.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nevertheless, other games that are in this ranking, although they were not developed by Nintendo, 
                are part of their platforms: such as <i>Grand Theft Auto</i> (5°), <i>FIFA</i> (6°).
