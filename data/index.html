                    Nintendo is a Japanese video game company founded in 1889 
                    (yes, <b>more than a century ago!</b>), known for creating some of the most popular video 
                    games in history, such as <i>Mario</i>, <i>The Legend of Zelda</i>, and <i>Pok√©mon</i>. 
                    Maybe you know that it distributed the 1<sup>st</sup> video console in Japan in 1997, 
                    but did you know it started off as a <b>playing card</b> company? 
                        (<a href="https://nintendolink.com/2021/06/02/that-time-nintendo-made-sexy-playing-cards-before-video-games-nsfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Not always for the whole family</a>)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Digging into the 
                    <a href="https://www.slashgear.com/862997/the-fascinating-history-of-nintendo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">company's history</a>, 
                    it seems that Nintendo has been a leader in the video game industry for decades. 
                    In fact, Nintendo invigorated this market after its 
                    <a href="https://www.bugsplat.com/blog/less-serious/great-video-game-crash-1983/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">80s crisis</a>. 
                    However, the company has faced new challenges in recent times that have pushed it to reinvent 
                    itself, and some believe the company has fallen behind by releasing <i>weaker</i> consoles 
                    than its competitors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But success is not measured by console power, and we are going to see why Nintendo is still a 
                    <b>reference</b> for the industry.
                </p>

        <div class="container">
            <h2>
                Console vs. Games
            </h2>
            <p>
                There are currently 3 manufacturers of video game <b>consoles</b> on the market: 
                <i>Microsoft</i>, <i>Nintendo</i>, and <i>Sony</i>, what we will call the <b>platforms</b>. 
                On the other hand, there is a large number of video game developers (<b>publishers</b>), 
                including the console manufacturers (which normally make video games for their own consoles), 
                as well as other companies that make video games, in general, for several consoles 
                simultaneously (e.g., <i>Activision</i> and <i>Electronic Arts</i>).
            </p>
            <p style="margin: 0px 0px;">
                Therefore, you can account for sales by platforms (all the videogames sold in a platform, 
                from many developers), or sales by the developer (which makes videogames to one to multiple 
                platforms). Nintendo plays on <b>both</b> sides.
            </p>
            <div class="flex-container">
                <div class="flex-item">
                    <p>
                        From a platform perspective, Nintendo is not behind its competitors. 
                        The right graph shows that, based on the <b>release date</b> of the video 
                        games, Nintendo's new releases have outperformed those of Sony or Microsoft, 
                        whose profits leverage heavily on previously released games.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is because, for a couple of years now, Nintendo has been trying to do something 
                        different with their consoles (while the rest of the market orbits around two consoles 
                        that do basically the same thing). This strategy has been working out phenomenally 
                        for Nintendo, focusing on <b>portability</b> and <b>lower prices</b>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The latter is evident in the pie chart below which also dissects through the consoles 
                        they have made. Although the comparison is unfair (Nintendo is older), the variety of 
                        consoles that Nintendo have offered is greater (and cheaper) than their competitors.
                        This has kept Nintendo in the leadership board, with historical sales <b>exceeding</b> 
                        those of its competitors. In this matter, the second position goes to <i>Sony</i>.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="flex-item chart">

                <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 30px;">
                    Favorable results are also observed when, instead of analyzing video game sales from a console 
                    hardware viewpoint, they are broken down according to <b>software production</b> 
                    (please press the 
                    Publisher button below).

                    Nintendo is the most profitable publisher followed by Activision and Electronic Arts (which 
                    make games for Nintendo consoles too), and notice that most of the video games from 
                    <i>Sony</i> and <i>Microsoft</i> platforms are not developed by them. Although this market 
                    is less concentrated than the platforms one (the "Others" block contains a huge number of
                    developers smaller than the smallest identified developer on the left side of the pie: 
                    <i>Take-Two Interactive</i>), Nintendo still dominates.

                    <p>
                        Nintendo games are concentrated into 2 main categories: platform games and role-playing games. 
                        Of the first, Nintendo accounts for around half of the historical sales of the entire market, 
                        while of the second category around a third (left chart).

                    <p>
                        Here is an interesting fact: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_game" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">platform games</a> 
                        are nothing more than those games where you have 
                        to move a character from one place to another on the board (like Mario), and this category was 
                        practically <b>born</b> with a video game from this company in 1981: Donkey Kong, "
                        <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/12/20/master-of-play" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>the first 
                            to have a substantial narrative, along with a sense of humor</i></a>".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mario debuted in that video game as <a href="https://time.com/3901489/donkey-kong-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Jumpman</i></a>, being one of the first characters to 
                        ever actually <b>jump</b> up in a video game (now it seems insubstantial, but that was such a 
                        hit at that time!).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Regarding latitudes, the database does not allow us to reach interesting conclusions, most 
                        video games are unclassified in this regard. For the classified, total market sales are 
                        concentrated in North America and Europe, while (unsurprisingly) Japanese Nintendo Sales 
                        exceed those of other regions.

                    Last but not least, Nintendo leads the top of <b>most popular</b> games of all time. In the chart 
                    below are the 30 most sold games in the whole history (and their release years), notice that Nintendo 
                    is the publisher of several ones (<a style="color:#00FFC6">green circles</a>), having the first 
                    (<i>Tetris</i>), second (<i>Pokemon</i>), and fourth place (<i>Super Mario</i>) in that ranking; 
                    however, all of them are <b>more than 20 years old!</b>

                    Other games that are in this ranking, although they were not developed by Nintendo, 
                    are part of their consoles environment: such as <i>Grand Theft Auto</i> (5<sup>th</sup>), and

                    Why are you interested in the topic?
                </p>
                <p class="pa">
                    In general, the video game industry is essential not only for its size but because of 
                    its cultural influence, and Nintendo is a wide-known reference in popular culture. 
                    Hence, I found it attractive to any potential reader. Also, this database was rich 
                    enough to allow exploring data across many dimensions (e.g., cross-sectional and 
                    time series) making it ideal for data visualization techniques implementation.
                </p>
                <p class="pq">
                    What were other options for data and why did you choose this data set?
                </p>
                <p class="pa">
                    Before I got to this topic, I explored 3 databases:
                </p>
                <p class="pa">
                    1) My first option was violence in Colombia over time (my idea was to find some kind 
                    of change in the patterns of these figures as a result of the peace process); however, the 
                    database had many missing values and some elements of the analysis could be a sensitive topic 
                    for some people.
                </p>
                <p class="pa">
                    2) My second choice was child violence (derived from the violence databases explored 
                    in 1), but I did not find this topic appropriate/appealing either. Also, data quality was 
                    unsatisfactory.
                </p>
                <p class="pa">
                    3) Lastly, I found records of an animal shelter that tracked all the animals that arrived 
                    there. The database included the reason the animals came to the shelter (abandonment, 
                    return, etc.), their health condition, whether they found a family, etc. I discarded 
                    this dataset because it was difficult to distinguish multiple records of the same pet 
                    and, therefore, remove duplicates (also because I did not like the topic).

                    Generally speaking, it started with an overall comparison between different game platforms 
                    and developers, then moved on to the games Nintendo has excelled at, and concluded with the 
                    company's place among the most popular games of all time. My story was linear. it began with 
                    a question whose answer could initially point in one direction, and I indicate the opposite 
                    to then chain evidence along the article to support my viewpoint while giving the reader 
                    additional information about Nintendo by way of fun facts.

                    Of the 20,000 videogames included, only 2.5% (497) did not have a publication date, 
                    however, this did not affect the quality of the analysis due to its small proportion over 
                    the whole sample. In contrast, a significant number of observations (4,067 which 
                    represented 20.3% of the sample) were not classified by region, so any 
                    relevant insight could be delivered in this direction (mentioned in the article).

                <p class="pa">
                    Although the choice of charts was made based on the information I wanted to show 
                    (and highlight) for each case, my decision incorporated the following criteria also:

                <p class="pa">
                    1) I find using graphics with which the user can interact extremely attractive, 
                    so I was biased toward this direction.
                </p>
                <p class="pa">
                    2) I chose graphics that would allow me to go beyond what I learned in class, which 
                    would challenge me to learn new techniques.

                    3) Graphics that condensed various dimensions of the database, allowing the reader to 
                    explore the data on their own, without overloading him/her.

                    In general, the whole process was very enriching. My main difficulty was not having 
                    previous experience with HTML or JavaScript, and learning the basics on the fly while 
                    also understanding the logic of D3 was somewhat overwhelming. In fact, for example, 
                    in the third graphic (which has 4 buttons that update it), I copied and pasted data 
                    from 4 JSON files because I couldn't declare a JavaScript constant attached to each of 
                    these files (which conceptually doesn't seem to be complicated).
                </p>
                <p class="pa">
                    Another important lesson is maintaining a holistic view of the process, ensuring that 
                    code hierarchies are preserved while working on several .js files (learned the hard way).
                </p>
                <p class="pa">
                    Some elements and transitions that I wanted to implement were not part of this delivery 
                    due to the deadlines (e.g., I did not achieve the tooltip for the last chart 
                    appearing under the mouse every time the user hovers over each circle, and instead left 
                    it fixed to the right of the chart). However, the door was left open to continue exploring.

                <p class="pa">
                    The main takeaway, from the class in general, was that this is an amazing topic and there 
                    is a lot to be learned.
