  <h1>Police Violence - 2015</h1>
	<h3>By Diego Martinez and Pedro Ramonetti</h3>
	<div>
		<p id="introduction">
      In 2020, in the middle of the COVID pandemic lockdowns, millions of Americans came out to the streets in a series of protests as a response from the killing of George Floyd on May 25th 2020. The message behind these protests, represents not only a sentiment of rage from the killing of a human being, but a sentiment of desperation and a demand for justice, given years of police brutality, particularly towards minorities.
      The debate around this brutality, divides opinions between those who justify the actions of the police and find them necessary to preserve the public order, and those who demand to defund the police and establish new mechanisms of public safety, including community based policing. 
      <br><br>
      In this piece of work, we examine some facts regarding the more than 1,500 individuals killed in 2015 by police authorities. We examine the racial profiling behind these killings, the mental health profiles of the killing individuals, and the trends along the year in the number of killings.

      <h2>% of killed individuals by race (from the total of police killing in 2015)</h2>
      <p>
        Black communities have been particularly harmed by police brutality over the years, becoming an outspoken voice against this violence, and establishing civil movements like Black Lives Matter to fight against these injustices, and the systematic racism in the US.
        <br><br>In 2015, we can see that 26.56% of the killed individuals were black. While this percentage might not necessarily represent the majority of the killings, it is still high when compared to the distribution of the population by race in 2015. According to the United States Census Bureau, the projected distribution of population by race for 2015 showed that 12.3% of individuals would identify themselves as black, while 62.4% would identify themselves as white. 
        <br><br>When looking at these percentages, we can find that being a black person in the US doubles your probability of being killed by the authorities, when compared to white individuals.
        <br><br>This chart type has been chosen because it allows us to compare multiple categories within the same data point. In this particular issue, this graph helps to visualize the rate that each race has among the total number of murders.
        <br><br>This chart could be improved by adding the distributional proportions of races in the overall population so the reader can infer if killings are effectively concentrated among some races in particular. For example, the current chart tells us that most of the killed individuals are white, but when comparing it with the overall population, it is likely that the killings of other races (minorities) overcome their population share (so they are more affected by this type of violence than the white population).

      <h2>% of killed individuals that showed a mental illness</h2>
      <p>
        From the more than 1500 killed individuals in 2015, we can see through the pie chart that an important rate of the killed individuals (21.3%) showed a mental health condition. 
        <br><br>The US is a country known to have very poor access to mental health services, especially because of the lack of affordability. When we talk about mentally ill people who end up being killed by the authorities, we are also talking about people who might have not received the proper help when needed, and whose condition led them to be killed.
        <br><br>For this case, we choose a pie because we also want to compare, but now we face a case with only 2 categories highly concentrated in one of them, so the pie chart allows the reader to visually realize how many victims suffer from mental illness compared with the victims without this problem.
        <br><br>The chart could be improved by adding a socio-economical component, to reinforce the argument of the lack of access given the affordability. Currently, the graph is limited to telling us solely the rate of mentally ill people killed by police, but not the stories behind these killings.

      <h2>Total number of killings by month</h2>
      <p>
        We can see how the number of killings is mostly consistent for the most part of the year, with two interesting spikes during spring and during the summer, which happen to be periods when the temperature increases.  
        <br><br>Multiple criminalistics have studied the reasons on why the violence tends to increase during the periods of temperature increasing. Among the arguments that try to explain this pattern, we can find changes in the behavior of the individuals, or the presence of more free time among potential perpetrators. 
        <br><br>While there is no conclusive argument for this pattern, we can see that police brutality is also correlated with this trend.
        <br><br>Finally, we wanted to observe the evolution of these figures over time, for which the line graph is more appropriate since it allows us to identify trends or the volatility of the data throughout the year 2015. A straightforward improvement would be to have a much broader time frame since with only one year it is not possible to identify trends robustly.
