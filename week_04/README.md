# Week 4
This week we have learned the basics to build line charts using D3 📈, including simple line charts (*line.html*), multi-line charts (*multiline.html*), and area charts (*area.html*). In this folder, you can find the files regarding the in-class exercise using long-term interest rates data, as well as the homework in which we replicate the exercise with the data for Canada. 

## Line Chart Exercise 📝
The homework regarding the long-term interest rates in Canada in 2020 is in the ***homework.html*** file. In addition to what we learned in class, I added markers to the chart using the reference material in the assignment.
