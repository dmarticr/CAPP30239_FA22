# Week 4
This week we have learned the basics of building line charts using D3 üìà, including simple line charts ([line](https://dmarticr.github.io/CAPP30239_FA22/week_04/line.html)), multi-line graphs ([multiline.html](https://dmarticr.github.io/CAPP30239_FA22/week_04/teacher_code/multiline.html)), and area charts ([area](https://dmarticr.github.io/CAPP30239_FA22/week_04/area.html)). In this folder, you can find the files regarding the in-class exercise using long-term interest rates data, the homework in which we replicate the task with the data for Canada ([homework](https://dmarticr.github.io/CAPP30239_FA22/week_04/homework.html)), as well as the document [Project 2: Analyzing Existing Data Visualizations](https://dmarticr.github.io/CAPP30239_FA22/week_04/project2.html) in which I analyze three visualizations.

## Line Chart Exercise üìù
The homework regarding the long-term interest rates in Canada in 2020 is in the [homework.html](https://dmarticr.github.io/CAPP30239_FA22/week_04/homework.html) file. In addition to what we learned in class, I added markers to the chart using the reference material in the assignment.
